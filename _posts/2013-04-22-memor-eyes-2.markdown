This is a memory game I made in Flash. The concept is pretty simple – I was more going for quality of execution. I think I did quite well as it still looks reasonably nice by today’s standards. I did make an earlier version (i.e. memor-eyes 1) but I hope it doesn’t exist anywhere on the Internet because it was awful. This one however is still good for a bit of distraction once in a while.

Music robbed from _Ape Escape_.
