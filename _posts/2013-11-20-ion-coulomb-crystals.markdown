During my masters, I undertook some theoretical research (with friend [Martin Asprusten](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/martin-asprusten/6a/a10/920) and supervised by [Professor Richard C. Thompson](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.thompson)) into ion traps and the Coulomb crystals that form in them when ions are laser-cooled. We produced a C++ simulation environment (the code for which can be found [here](http://bitbucket.org/simonwo/iontrap)) which ended up with some interesting results.

Iâ€™ve been very fortunate in having the results deemed interesting enough to be published in [_Applied Physics B_](http://link.springer.com/journal/340 "Applied Physics B") as part of a special edition of the journal published for the 100th birthday of [Wolfgang Paul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Paul), a German physicist whose research was instrumental in the creation of the modern ion trap.
